# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

#   And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

# You will need to use a for loop to write this:


#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡


# import time

# for i in range(1, 6):
#   print(f"{i}Mississippi")
#   time.sleep(1)

# print("Ready or not, here I come!")


# for number in range(1, 101):
#     if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
#         print("FizzBuzz")
#     elif number % 3 == 0:
#         print("Fizz")
#     elif number % 5 == 0:
#         print("Buzz")
#     else:
#         print(number)



for number in range(1, 101):
    output = ""
    if number % 3 == 0:
        output += "Fizz"
    if number % 5 == 0:
        output += "Buzz"
    print(output or number)
